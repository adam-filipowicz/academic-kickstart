# Workflow for Lab 02

The lab instructions can be found [here](https://stevenbedrick.github.io/data-vis-labs-2020/02-moma.html); we will work through its contents together via Webex. You will use this RMarkdown file as your workspace and final document. Don't forget to update the "author" metadata field at the top of the file!

# Start by Loading Libraries

Load packages readr, here, tidyverse, and ggthemes

```{r}
library(readr)
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
library(extrafont)
```

We're going to read in the cleaned up data set containing only paintings and drawings in the MoMA collection:
```{r}
library(dplyr)
moma <- read_csv(here::here("artworks-cleaned.csv"))
```

# Know Your Data

Let's use dplyr to get to know our data.

## How Many Paintings?

```{r}
moma
```
```{r}
glimpse(moma)
```
Looks like 2,253 paintings (rows) and 23 variables (columns) are in moma.

## What is the first painting that was acquired?

```{r}
moma %>% 
  select(artist, title, year_acquired) %>% 
  arrange(year_acquired)
```

The first paining acquired was "House by the Railroad" by Edward Hopper in 1930.

## What is the oldest painting?

```{r}
moma %>% 
  select(artist, title, year_created) %>% 
  arrange(year_created)
```

The oldest painting, "Landscape at Daybreak" by Odilon Redon, is from 1872.

## How many artists?

```{r}
moma %>% 
  distinct(artist)
```

989 rows there, so there are 989 distinct artists.

## Which artist has the most paintings?

```{r}
moma %>% 
  count(artist, sort = TRUE)
```

Pablo Picasso has the most paintings, at 55 total paintings.

## How many paintings, by gender?

```{r}
moma %>% 
  count(artist_gender)
```

So 252 paintings by females, and 1991 by males, and 10 paintings with no information available.

## How many artists, by gender?

```{r}
moma %>% 
  count(artist_gender, artist) %>% 
  count(artist_gender)
```

By using count twice, we can pull out how many unique artists there are per gender: 143 females, 837 males, and 9 N/A.

## In which years were the most paintings in the collection _acquired_?

```{r}
moma %>% 
  count(year_acquired, sort = TRUE)
```

1985 saw the most paintings acquired, at 86 paintings.

## In which years were the most paintings in the collection _created_?

```{r}
moma %>% 
  count(year_created, sort = TRUE)
```

The most common year of creation for paintings in the collection was 1977, with 57 of the paintings created in that year.

## What about the first painting by a solo female artist?

```{r}
moma %>% 
  filter (num_artists == 1 & n_female_artists == 1) %>%
  select(title, artist, year_acquired, year_created) %>% 
  arrange(year_acquired)
```

"Landscape, 47" created by Natalia Goncharova in 1912, was the first painting by a solo female artist acquired, added to the collection in 1937.

# Basic Plotting!

## Year painted vs. year acquired

```{r}
ggplot(moma, aes(year_created, year_acquired)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .1, na.rm = TRUE) +
  geom_abline(intercept = c(0,0), colour = "red") +
  labs(x = "Year Painted", y = "Year Acquired") +
  ggtitle("MoMA Keeps Its Collection Current")
```


## Faceting by gender

```{r}
moma_solo <- moma %>% 
  filter(num_artists == 1)
ggplot(moma_solo, aes(year_created, year_acquired)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .1) +
  geom_abline(intercept = c(0,0), colour = "red") +
  labs(x = "Year Painted", y = "Year Acquired") +
  ggtitle("MoMA Keeps Its Collection Current") +
  facet_wrap(~artist_gender)
```


# Exploring Painting Dimensions

```{r}
moma_dim <- moma %>% 
  filter(height_cm < 600, width_cm < 760) %>% 
  mutate(hw_ratio = height_cm / width_cm,
         hw_cat = case_when(
           hw_ratio > 1 ~ "taller than wide",
           hw_ratio < 1 ~ "wider than tall",
           hw_ratio == 1 ~ "perfect square"
         ))
library(ggthemes)
ggplot(moma_dim, aes(x = width_cm, y = height_cm, colour = hw_cat)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .5) +
  ggtitle("MoMA Paintings, Tall and Wide") +
  scale_colour_manual(name = "",
                      values = c("gray50", "#FF9900", "#B14CF0")) +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  theme(axis.title = element_text()) +
  labs(x = "Width", y = "Height")
```


## Challenge #4

## Different colors

```{r}
library(ggthemes)
ggplot(moma_dim, aes(x = width_cm, y = height_cm, colour = hw_cat)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .5) +
  ggtitle("MoMA Paintings, Tall and Wide") +
  scale_colour_manual(name = "",
                      values = c("gray50", "#ee5863", "#6999cd")) +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  theme(axis.title = element_text()) +
  labs(x = "Width", y = "Height") 
```


## Experimenting with `geom_annotate()`

```{r}
library(ggthemes)
ggplot(moma_dim, aes(x = width_cm, y = height_cm, colour = hw_cat)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .5, show.legend = FALSE) +
  ggtitle("MoMA Paintings, Tall and Wide") +
  scale_colour_manual(name = "",
                      values = c("gray50", "#ee5863", "#6999cd")) +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  theme(axis.title = element_text()) +
  labs(x = "Width", y = "Height") +
  annotate(x = 200, y = 380, geom = "text", 
           label = "Taller than\nWide", color = "#ee5863", 
           size = 5, family = "Lato", hjust = 1, fontface = 2) +
    annotate(x = 375, y = 100, geom = "text", 
             label = "Wider than\nTall", color = "#6999cd", 
             size = 5, family = "Lato", hjust = 0, fontface = 2)
```


# Challenge #5, on your own!

I want to delve into the gender distribution of the MoMA collection a bit further. The graph by Twitter user @EamonCaddigan served as inspiration: https://twitter.com/EamonCaddigan/status/626861365546848256. First, let's switch the ordering of the "Male" and "Female" groups using forcats. This is just for aesthetic purposes later. We'll also take a look at the mean for each group in terms of "Year Acquired"

```{r}
library(forcats)
moma_solo_relevel <- moma_solo %>% 
  mutate(artist_gender = fct_relevel(artist_gender, "Male", "Female"))

mu <- moma_solo_relevel %>% 
  group_by(artist_gender) %>%  
  summarize(grp.mean=mean(year_acquired, na.rm = TRUE))
head(mu)
```

Looks like the average acquisition year for paintings by male artists was 1973, while the average for female artists was 1988. With this information, we can already suspect that in the early years the collection skewed heavily toward male artists while in more recent years an effort has been made to acquire more work by female artists. Let's make an attempt at graphing this to get a better sense of what the trend is. I'm going to use a bar chart to give me the counts for each year of acquisition, and break them up by gender.

```{r}
ggplot(moma_solo_relevel, aes(x=year_acquired, fill=artist_gender, color=artist_gender)) +
  geom_bar(alpha = 0.7, position = "stack", show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_vline(data=mu, aes(xintercept=grp.mean, color=artist_gender),
             linetype="dashed", show.legend = FALSE) +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("#63ACBE", "#EE442F")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#63ACBE", "#EE442F")) +
  theme(axis.title = element_text()) +
  labs(x = "Year Acquired", y = "Count") +
  ggtitle("Gender Distribution of the MoMA Collection") +
  annotate(x = 1973, y = 75, geom = "text", 
           label = "Average->\nMales    ", color = "#63ACBE", 
           size = 5, family = "Lato", hjust = 1, fontface = 3) +
    annotate(x = 1989, y = 75, geom = "text", 
             label = "<-Average\n    Females", color = "#EE442F", 
             size = 5, family = "Lato", hjust = 0, fontface = 3)
```

By raw counts we can clearly see that overall the collection skews heavily male, though, as we suspected, in recent years more of an effort has gone into acquiring work by female artists.

Another way to represent this would be to use a density plot:

```{r}
ggplot(moma_solo_relevel, aes(x=year_acquired, color=artist_gender, fill=artist_gender)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.7, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_vline(data=mu, aes(xintercept=grp.mean, color=artist_gender),
             linetype="dashed", show.legend = FALSE) +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("#63ACBE", "#EE442F")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#63ACBE", "#EE442F")) +
  theme(axis.title = element_text()) +
  labs(x = "Year Acquired", y = "Density") +
  ggtitle("Gender Distribution of the MoMA Collection") + 
  annotate(x = 1973, y = .02, geom = "text", 
           label = "Average->\nMales    ", color = "#63ACBE", 
           size = 5, family = "Lato", hjust = 1, fontface = 3) +
  annotate(x = 1989, y = .02, geom = "text", 
             label = "<-Average\n    Females", color = "#EE442F", 
             size = 5, family = "Lato", hjust = 0, fontface = 3)
```

This graph makes even more clear that the collection has started to acquire more paintings by females in recent years, with it being quite low at the earliest time points in this data set. Acquisitions of paintings by males has remained pretty steady throughout the time period analyzed here. The drop off for both groups at the right edge of the graph represents the fact that it usually takes the MoMA some years to add pieces to their collection. We looked at one way of representing this above, but with just some simple math I think we could make it look better (and also fit it to a generalized additive model to see the trend more clearly). Another Twitter user, had the same idea, though I don't know how the trend-line was produced: https://twitter.com/freakonometrics/status/626274944293449728.

```{r}
ggplot(moma, aes(year_acquired, year_acquired-year_created)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .1, na.rm = TRUE) +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE, color = "#EE442F") +
  theme_tufte() +
  labs(x = "Year Acquired", y = "Age (years) at time of acquisition") +
  ggtitle("MoMA Keeps Things Fresh")
```

This is pretty much the same as the first graph we made up above, but shifted so that the identity line (y=x) is now just the x-axis. The trend-line is based on a GAM, which makes clear that there is usually a bit of lag between the creation of a painting and it being acquired by the MoMA, with the lag time showing a slight increase over the years.
