Hello! I am a graduate student in the Neuroscience Graduate Program at OHSU. My research interests include behavioral genetics, neuroimmune interactions, the use of models in biology. I am currently a member of the Aballay Lab, where we use the simple model organism *Caenorhabditis elegans* to study mechanisms involved in the control of immune responses against microbial pathogens. My current project focuses on the nematode response to *Enterococcus faecalis*, a gram-positive bacterium and an opportunistic pathogen in humans.

While on break from working at the bench due to COVID-19, I am expanding my data science programming skills via two remote courses offered through the computer science department at OHSU.
