abstract: 'The use of *C. elegans* as a model for host-pathogen interactions is well established and has revealed a diverse set of sensory modalities that the worm engages in order to initiate protective behaviors including olfaction, aerotaxis, and mechanosensation. Much focus has gone into understanding the learned aversion of the initially attractive Gram-negative *P. aeruginosa*. Gram-positive infections, most notably with *Enterococcus* species, have been described in the worm, though no report on the behavioral response to these pathogens exists. Using choice assays, we observed that *Enterococcus* species are initially not preferred over standard E. coli OP50. Further, the wormâ€™s behavioral response when presented with a single lawn of *Enterococcus faecalis*, *E. faecium*, or *S. aureus* consists of two distinct phases of avoidance: an early (1-4hr) avoidance and a late (>12hr) avoidance behavior reminiscent of the response to *P. aeruginosa*. The early, but not late, avoidance was found to be NPR-1 and TAX-2/4 dependent. Rescuing expression of tax-2 in specific chemosensory neurons revealed that its expression in ASE neurons, known to play a role in chemotaxis and depleted-food leaving, is crucial for early avoidance of Gram-positive pathogens. Dissecting the neural circuitry further using genetically ablated neurons suggested that a synaptic partner of ASE neurons, the olfactory AWC neurons, also play a role in this early avoidance behavior, and may govern the initial preference in the choice assay. The lack of a role for NPR-1 in the late avoidance phase is surprising given its previously described role in avoidance using P. aeruginosa but reflects how different sensory pathways are engaged in response to varying environmental situations. Overall, the relatively fast avoidance of Gram-positive bacterial species by the worm provides a useful model to uncover elements of microbial cue sensation and to elucidate how that information is integrated to initiate protective behaviors.'
