I am a graduate student in the Neuroscience Graduate Program at OHSU. My research interests include behavioral genetics, neuroimmune interactions, and the use of models and computational tools in biology. I am currently a member of the Aballay Lab, where we use the simple model organism *Caenorhabditis elegans* (pictured above my name with some glowing bacteria in its intestine) to study neuronal mechanisms involved in immune responses to microbial pathogens. My dissertation work focuses on understanding basic mechanisms of behavioral immunity. To do this I use a variety of approaches including genetic manipulations, connectome (we have a complete one for *C. elegans*) manipulations and simulations, and behavioral assays. Prior to this, I was a research assistant with Dr. Woong-Ki Kim at EVMS, where we used a rhesus macaque model of HIV infection to study the viral effects on the brain.

The [Projects](#projects) section contains some web apps and Jupyter notebooks I've developed.

I also blog over at [The Dialectical Neuroscientist](http://dialecticneuro.com/), where I write about neuroscience, philosophy, and society.
