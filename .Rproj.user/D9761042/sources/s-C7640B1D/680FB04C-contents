abstract: 'Increased expression of CD169 on monocytes has been reported in HIV-1-infected humans. Using rhesus macaque models of HIV infection, we sought to investigate whether simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection upregulates CD169 expression on monocytes/macrophages. We also sought to determine whether CD8 T cells and plasma viral load directly impact the expression of CD169 on monocytes during SIV infection. We longitudinally assessed monocyte expression of CD169 during the course of SIV infection by flow cytometry, and examined the expression of CD169 on macrophages by immunohistochemistry in the spleen and lymph nodes of uninfected and infected macaques. CD169 expression on monocytes was substantially upregulated as early as 4 days during the hyperacute phase and peaked by 5-15 days after infection. After a transient decrease following the peak, its expression continued to increase during progression to AIDS. Monocyte CD169 expression was directly associated with plasma viral loads. To determine the contribution of CD8(+) T lymphocytes and virus to the control of monocyte CD169 expression, we used experimental CD8(+) lymphocyte depletion and antiretroviral therapy (ART) in SIV-infected macaques. Rapid depletion of CD8 T cells during acute infection of rhesus macaques induced an abrupt increase in CD169 expression. Importantly, levels of CD169 expression plummeted following initiation of ART and rebounded upon cessation of therapy. Taken together, our data reveal independent roles for virus and CD8(+) T lymphocytes in controlling monocyte CD169 expression, which may be an important link in further investigating the host response to viral infection.'
